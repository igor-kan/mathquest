Sometimes we need to combine evidence to build a stronger case. Logical connectives help us do this precisely.

**The Logical Connectives:**

**Conjunction (‚àß) - "AND"**
‚Ä¢ Both conditions must be true
‚Ä¢ "The alarm was triggered AND the window was broken"
‚Ä¢ Symbol: ‚àß (like an upside-down V)

**Disjunction (‚à®) - "OR"** 
‚Ä¢ At least one condition must be true
‚Ä¢ "The thief entered through the window OR the door"
‚Ä¢ Symbol: ‚à® (like a V)

**Negation (¬¨) - "NOT"**
‚Ä¢ The opposite of the statement
‚Ä¢ "The security guard was NOT at his post"
‚Ä¢ Symbol: ¬¨

**Truth Conditions:**
‚Ä¢ P ‚àß Q is true only when both P and Q are true
‚Ä¢ P ‚à® Q is true when at least one of P or Q is true

Euclid approaches the class with a knowing smile...

"Students, today I teach you *reductio ad absurdum* - proof by contradiction. When direct proof seems impossible, we assume the opposite and show it leads to nonsense!"

**The Method:**
1. **Assume the negation** of what you want to prove
2. **Use logical reasoning** to derive consequences  
3. **Find a contradiction** - something that cannot be true
4. **Conclude** the assumption must be false
5. **Therefore** the original statement must be true

**When to Use:**
‚Ä¢ Proving negative statements ("There is no largest prime")
‚Ä¢ Proving uniqueness ("The solution is unique")  
‚Ä¢ Proving irrationality ("‚àö2 is irrational")
‚Ä¢ When direct proof seems difficult

**Classic Example: ‚àö2 is Irrational**
1. Assume ‚àö2 is rational (can be written as a/b in lowest terms)
2. Then ‚àö2 = a/b where gcd(a,b) = 1
3. Squaring: 2 = a¬≤/b¬≤, so 2b¬≤ = a¬≤
4. This means a¬≤ is even, so a is even
5. Let a = 2k, then 2b¬≤ = 4k¬≤, so b¬≤ = 2k¬≤
6. This means b¬≤ is even, so b is even
7. **Contradiction!** Both a and b are even, but gcd(a,b) = 1
8. Therefore ‚àö2 must be irrational

A set is simply a collection of distinct objects, called elements or members.

**Notation:**
‚Ä¢ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - roster notation (list the elements)
‚Ä¢ B = {x | x is an even integer} - set-builder notation (describe the property)
‚Ä¢ a ‚àà A means "a is an element of A"
‚Ä¢ a ‚àâ A means "a is not an element of A"

**Special Sets:**
‚Ä¢ ‚àÖ or {} - the empty set (contains nothing)
‚Ä¢ ‚Ñï = {1, 2, 3, ...} - natural numbers
‚Ä¢ ‚Ñ§ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} - integers  
‚Ä¢ ‚Ñö - rational numbers (fractions)
‚Ä¢ ‚Ñù - real numbers

**Set Operations:**
‚Ä¢ **Union (A ‚à™ B):** All elements in A or B (or both)
‚Ä¢ **Intersection (A ‚à© B):** Elements in both A and B
‚Ä¢ **Difference (A - B):** Elements in A but not in B
