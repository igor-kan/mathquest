f is continuous at c if:

**Definition of a Group:**
A group (G, ‚àó) is a set G with an operation ‚àó satisfying:

1. **Closure:** For all a, b ‚àà G, a ‚àó b ‚àà G
2. **Associativity:** (a ‚àó b) ‚àó c = a ‚àó (b ‚àó c)
3. **Identity:** There exists e ‚àà G such that e ‚àó a = a ‚àó e = a for all a ‚àà G
4. **Inverse:** For each a ‚àà G, there exists a‚Åª¬π ‚àà G such that a ‚àó a‚Åª¬π = a‚Åª¬π ‚àó a = e

**Topological Space:**
A topological space (X, œÑ) consists of:
‚Ä¢ A set X
‚Ä¢ A collection œÑ of subsets of X (called open sets) such that:
  1. ‚àÖ and X are in œÑ
  2. Any union of sets in œÑ is in œÑ
  3. Any finite intersection of sets in œÑ is in œÑ

**Basic Concepts:**
‚Ä¢ **Open sets:** Elements of œÑ
‚Ä¢ **Closed sets:** Complements of open sets
‚Ä¢ **Neighborhood:** Open set containing a point
‚Ä¢ **Interior:** Largest open set contained in a set
‚Ä¢ **Closure:** Smallest closed set containing a set

**Examples:**
‚Ä¢ Discrete topology: Every subset is open
‚Ä¢ Indiscrete topology: Only ‚àÖ and X are open
‚Ä¢ Euclidean topology: Based on open balls

**Continuous Functions:**
f: X ‚Üí Y is continuous if the preimage of every open set in Y is open in X`,

**Compact Set (Cover Definition):**
A set K is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover.

**Open Cover:** A collection of open sets whose union contains K
**Finite Subcover:** A finite subcollection that still covers K

**Equivalent Characterizations:**
In metric spaces, the following are equivalent:
1. K is compact (every open cover has finite subcover)
2. K is sequentially compact (every sequence has convergent subsequence)
3. K is complete and totally bounded

**Heine-Borel Theorem:**
In ‚Ñù‚Åø, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.

**Properties of Compact Sets:**
‚Ä¢ Continuous images of compact sets are compact
‚Ä¢ Compact sets in metric spaces are closed and bounded
‚Ä¢ Finite unions and arbitrary intersections preserve compactness
