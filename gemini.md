# MathQuest - Gemini AI Integration

## Mathematical AI Implementation

**MathQuest** integrates Google Gemini 1.5-pro for intelligent mathematics education with gamified learning and adaptive problem generation.

### Unique AI Features
- **Mathematical Problem Generation**: Context-aware problem creation across algebra, geometry, calculus, and logic
- **Solution Verification**: Multi-step solution checking with error identification
- **Adaptive Difficulty Engine**: Performance-based complexity adjustment 
- **Progress Analytics**: Learning pattern analysis with predictive insights

## Mathematical AI Prompts

```typescript
export const mathPrompts = {
  problemGeneration: `Generate a ${difficulty} ${topic} problem with:
1. Clear problem statement
2. Step-by-step solution  
3. Key concepts tested
4. Common mistake warnings
5. 2-3 practice variations`,

  solutionVerification: `Check student work:
Problem: ${problem}
Student Solution: ${studentSolution}
Provide: correctness, error identification, improvement guidance`,

  adaptiveDifficulty: `Analyze performance: ${userStats}
Recommend next difficulty level and problem types for optimal learning progression`
};

export interface MathResponse {
  problem: string;
  solution: string[];
  concepts: string[];
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  hints: string[];
}
```
